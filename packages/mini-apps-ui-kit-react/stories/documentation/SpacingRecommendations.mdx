# Spacing Recommendations

- **Main paddings**: It is recommended to use a default padding of `24px `to ensure ample breathing room around elements and maintain a clean, structured appearance.

- **Sections**: It is recommended to set the default space between sections to `40px` to create clear separation between distinct areas of content. For subheadlines and their associated content, a spacing of `24px` is advised to maintain a visual connection between headers and their content.

- **Button**: It is recommended to position buttons with a `24px` space from the iOS bottom bar to ensure optimal accessibility and provide a comfortable tap area.

- **Button with active keyboard**: It is recommended to place buttons `24px` above the active keyboard to keep them easily accessible and visually distinct, preventing accidental taps or overlap when the keyboard is active.

- **States**: It is recommended to use middle alignment to ensure consistency across various screen sizes and component states. This approach helps create a polished and intentional interface, particularly effective for empty states, loading indicators, or other transient states, ensuring a seamless and cohesive user experience.

- **Bottom menu**: It is recommended to position the bottom menu with a `20px` padding from the iOS bottom bar to create a comfortable buffer that enhances touch accessibility and aligns with native iOS design guidelines. Additionally, a minimum padding of `8px` from the top of the menu is advised to provide necessary breathing room.
