# Spacing

## 4px layout system

By establishing 4px as the foundational measurement, it simplifies spacing, sizing, and alignment across all components, making designs easier to adapt to different screen sizes and resolutions. This system encourages uniformity in padding, margins, and element dimensions, resulting in a structured, clean, and balanced appearance. Ideal for modern UI kits.

## Main paddings

Padding is set to a default of 24px, providing ample breathing room around elements while maintaining a clean and structured appearance.

## Sections

The default space between sections is set to 40px. This larger spacing helps to create clear separation between distinct areas of content.

16px spacing between subheadlines and their associated content. This deliberate spacing provides a clear visual connection between headers and their content.

## Button with active keyboard

Buttons are placed 24px above the active keyboard. This spacing ensures that buttons remain easily accessible and visually distinct, even when the keyboard is active, preventing accidental taps or overlap.

## States

## Bottom menu

It is recommended to position the bottom menu with a `20px` padding from the iOS bottom bar to create a comfortable buffer that enhances touch accessibility and aligns with native iOS design guidelines. Additionally, a minimum padding of `8px` from the top of the menu is advised to provide necessary breathing room.
