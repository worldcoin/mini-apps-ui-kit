# Spacing

<Section title="4px layout system" image={moduleImage}>
  By establishing `4px` as the foundational measurement, it simplifies spacing, sizing, and alignment across all components, making designs easier to adapt to different screen sizes and resolutions. This system encourages uniformity in padding, margins, and element dimensions, resulting in a structured, clean, and balanced appearance. Ideal for modern UI kits.

<Section title="Main paddings" image={mainImage}>
  Padding is set to a default of `24px`, providing ample breathing room around elements while maintaining a clean and structured appearance.
</Section>

<Section title="Sections" image={sectionImage}>
  The default space between sections is set to `40px`. This larger spacing helps to create clear separation between distinct areas of content.

  `16px` spacing between subheadlines and their associated content. This deliberate spacing provides a clear visual connection between headers and their content.
