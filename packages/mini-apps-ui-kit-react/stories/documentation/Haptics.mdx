# Haptics

> **Note:** All interactive components in the UI Kit already include appropriate haptic feedback by default. This documentation is provided for understanding the haptic feedback system and for custom implementations.

<br/>

Haptic feedback can improve the user experience by:

- **Enhancing Responsiveness**: Immediate tactile feedback makes interactions feel faster and more satisfying.
- **Improving Accessibility**: Haptics can help users with visual impairments by providing an additional layer of feedback.
- **Increasing Engagement**: Users are more likely to enjoy and continue using apps that feel interactive and responsive.
